## Demo Flow

### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)

- **Introduce the team and project:**
  "We're CredTech, and we've developed XScore, an explainable credit scoring system that helps financial institutions make more transparent and fair lending decisions."

- **Highlight the problem:**
  "Traditional credit scoring systems are often black boxes, making it difficult for both lenders and borrowers to understand why certain decisions are made. This lack of transparency creates issues with regulatory compliance, customer trust, and potential bias."

- **Present our solution:**
  "XScore combines machine learning with explainability techniques to provide accurate credit risk assessments while clearly explaining the factors that influence each score."

### 2. System Architecture (2 minutes)

- Show the architecture diagram (from README.md)
- Explain the key components:
  - Data ingestion pipeline
  - Feature engineering process
  - Model training with LightGBM
  - SHAP-based explainability layer
  - Streamlit web interface

- Highlight the production-ready aspects:
  - Containerized with Docker
  - Logging and error handling
  - Comprehensive testing
  - Security considerations

### 3. Live Demo (5 minutes)

1. **Open the Streamlit app** at http://localhost:8501
   - "Let's start by running our Streamlit application, which provides an intuitive interface for credit analysts to interact with our model."
   - Point out the clean, professional UI design

2. **Show the pipeline execution:**
   - "Before diving into the app, let me quickly show how our pipeline works."
   - Open a terminal and run: `python run_all.py --cv`
   - Highlight the logging output showing each step of the process
   - "Our pipeline handles data ingestion, feature engineering, and model training with cross-validation, all with a single command."

3. **Show the sample profiles feature:**
   - "Our system comes with pre-configured sample profiles to demonstrate different credit scenarios."
   - Select the "AAA-Rated Corporation" profile
   - Point out the high credit score (90+) and "AAA" rating
   - "This corporation has strong financial ratios, positive news sentiment, and stable cash flows."

4. **Demonstrate the explainability features:**
   - "What sets our system apart is its transparency. Let's look at what factors are influencing this score."
   - Navigate to the Explanation tab
   - Show the SHAP waterfall chart: "This visualization shows exactly how each feature contributes to pushing the score higher or lower."
   - Point out the top 3 positive factors: "High interest coverage ratio, low debt-to-EBITDA, and positive news sentiment."
   - Show the reason codes: "We translate these technical factors into plain-language explanations that anyone can understand."

5. **Show a contrasting profile:**
   - Select the "Distressed Company" profile
   - Point out the lower score (30-40) and "C" rating
   - "Notice how different factors affect this profile - negative news sentiment, declining revenue trends, and high leverage ratios all contribute to the lower score."
   - Highlight how the same model provides consistent but different explanations based on the input data

6. **Demonstrate manual input and what-if analysis:**
   - Switch to "Manual Entry" mode
   - "Let's see how a credit analyst might use this tool to perform what-if analysis."
   - Adjust key parameters (e.g., improve debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 5.2 to 3.0)
   - Show how the score and explanations update in real-time
   - "This allows analysts to provide actionable feedback to clients on how to improve their credit profile."

7. **Highlight the technical details:**
   - Navigate to the Technical Details tab
   - Show the model information: "We're using a LightGBM classifier with careful hyperparameter tuning."
   - Show the feature importance chart: "These are the most predictive features across our entire dataset."
   - Show the model metrics: "Our model achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.92 and a precision-recall AUC of 0.88, with excellent calibration."

### 4. Business Value & Impact (2 minutes)

- **Regulatory compliance:**
  "XScore helps financial institutions meet regulatory requirements for explainable lending decisions, including those under GDPR and fair lending laws."

- **Customer trust:**
  "By providing clear explanations for credit decisions, institutions can build trust with customers and reduce disputes."

- **Risk management:**
  "The system helps lenders better understand risk factors and make more informed decisions."

- **Financial inclusion:**
  "By making credit scoring more transparent, we can help address biases and potentially expand access to credit for underserved populations."

### 5. Technical Innovations (2 minutes)
